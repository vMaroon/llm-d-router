// Package controller contains the implementation of the FlowController engine.
//
// # Overview
//
// The FlowController is the central processing engine of the Flow Control layer. It manages the lifecycle of all
// incoming requests from initial submission to a terminal outcome (dispatch, rejection, or eviction).
//
// # Architecture
//
// The engine is split into two cooperating roles:
//
//   - The FlowController: The public-facing API of the system. Each call to EnqueueAndWait runs on its own (caller's)
//     goroutine: it acquires a flow lease from the contracts.FlowRegistry, hands the request to the Processor, and
//     blocks until the request is finalized. It owns asynchronous finalization driven by the request Context
//     (TTL/cancellation) and queue occupancy metrics.
//   - The internal.Processor (Worker): A single, stateful, single-goroutine actor that owns the request data plane. It
//     runs the dispatch loop, performs capacity checks, sweeps externally finalized items, and finalizes requests
//     synchronously (dispatch, capacity rejection, shutdown).
//
// # Concurrency Model
//
// The FlowController is designed to be highly concurrent and thread-safe. This rests on two properties:
//
//   - EnqueueAndWait: Can be called concurrently by many goroutines, each handing its item to the single Processor over
//     a buffered channel.
//   - Single-Writer Actor: Routing all state mutations through the Processor's single Run goroutine makes complex
//     transactions (such as capacity checks) inherently atomic without coarse-grained locks.
//
// # Request Lifecycle and Ownership
//
// A request (represented internally as a FlowItem) has a lifecycle managed cooperatively by the Controller and a
// Processor. Defining ownership is critical for ensuring an item is finalized exactly once.
//
//  1. Submission (Controller): The Controller attempts to hand off the item to a Processor.
//  2. Handoff:
//     - Success: Ownership transfers to the Processor, which is now responsible for Finalization.
//     - Failure: Ownership remains with the Controller, which must Finalize the item.
//  3. Processing (Processor): The Processor enqueues, manages, and eventually dispatches or rejects the item.
//  4. Finalization: The terminal outcome is set. This can happen:
//     - Synchronously: The Processor determines the outcome (e.g., Dispatch, Capacity Rejection).
//     - Asynchronously: The Controller observes the request's Context expiry (TTL/Cancellation) and calls Finalize.
//
// The FlowItem uses atomic operations to safely coordinate the Finalization state across goroutines.
